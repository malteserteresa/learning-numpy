### Numpy Practice & Stats Class

Because there aren't enough online tutorials out there!


This repository is intended for me to build a set of tutorials that I can
use to help my fellow qualitative friends begin to get their heads around
stats and programming. To make this a little more interesting for myself and
to ease installation, I will only use the standard library, visualization
libraries and numpy.
